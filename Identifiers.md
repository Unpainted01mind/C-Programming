### Identifiers :-
An identifier is a unique name given to a program element such as array,variable,function etc which is used to refer them later in the program.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int var=10;
    int arr[]={1,2,3};
    printf("Value of the variable is: ",var);
    return 0;
}
```
In the above program var is an identifier for an integer type variable to store the value 10 , which is being referred in the print function.
